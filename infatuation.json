Yes, Jitlada is LA’s best Thai spot, but they’re also one of the best restaurants in the entire city. Their massive, 400-item menu has dishes you know - like the ubiquitous pad thai - and ones you don’t, but will, like jungle curry with pork and crispy catfish salad. Plus, the food here is spicy spicy, which is perfect for masking your real tears when your friend asks you when you’ll be coming back.",

But then a tow truck will blast by, and save you from thinking even more embarrassing, hack philosophy sh*t  that you probably got from a shirt at Target. But that’s kind of why Neptune’s Net is the perfect place for a last meal in LA - although the seafood is not the best in the world, or even in this section of the guide, there’s just something about the seas of biker gangs, the direct view of the ocean, and the clam chowder served in gigantic, hollowed-out bread bowls that makes you want to take a second to reflect on life before heading back to reality.",
